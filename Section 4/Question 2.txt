may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it. It is
complex to create programs based on interaction of objects. Some of the key
programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be
challenging to comprehend initially.

2. Larger program size: Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code
than procedural program. Its slower than other procedural program.

3. Programmers need to have brilliant designing skill and programming skill along with proper planning because using OOP is little bit tricky.
