Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
when we need to perform a single action in different ways that time we should use Polymorphism.
In other words, when  we need to perform one interface and have multiple implementations.

For Example:

class Bank{  
float RateOfInterest(){return 0;}  
}  
class BracBank extends Bank{  
float RateOfInterest(){return 2.5f;}  
}  
class UcbBank extends Bank{  
float RateOfInterest(){return 10.5f;}  
}  
class CityBank extends Bank{  
float RateOfInterest(){return 3.5f;}  
}   


Here we consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides a method to get the rate of interest.
However, the rate of interest may differ according to banks.
