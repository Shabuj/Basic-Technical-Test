Shared memory is a memory shared between two or more processes.
It is an efficient means of passing data between programs.
Depending on context, programs may run on a single processor or on multiple separate processors.
Using memory for communication inside a single program, e.g. among its multiple threads, is also referred to as shared memory.

We know that to communicate between two or more processes, we use shared memory.
